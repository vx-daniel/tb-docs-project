  # Task: Review and Update Documentation

  ## Objective
  Review the documentation in `/docs/08-message-queue/` and enhance it using the official ThingsBoard documentation as the authoritative reference source.

  ## Source Materials
  - **Current docs to update:** `docs/08-message-queue/`
  - **Official reference:** `ref/thingsboard.github.io-master/` 

  ## Review Process
  1. **Audit current docs** - Identify gaps, inaccuracies, or outdated information
  2. **Cross-reference** - Compare against official docs for completeness
  3. **Update** - Revise content while preserving accurate existing material

  ## Content Requirements

  ### Style & Tone
  - Use technology-agnostic language (describe behavior/contracts, avoid Java-specific implementation details)
  - Write for junior developers with basic distributed systems knowledge
  - Be clear and concise; prefer shorter sentences

  ### Structure (each document must include)
  - Overview section explaining the "what" and "why"
  - At least one Mermaid diagram illustrating architecture or data flow
  - Practical examples with configuration snippets
  - "Common Pitfalls" section documenting gotchas
  - Cross-references to related documentation sections

  ### Content Depth
  This documentation should enable a junior developer to:
  - Understand how ThingsBoard's message queue system works conceptually
  - Configure queue settings for common use cases
  - Troubleshoot typical queue-related issues
  - Make informed decisions about queue topology for different deployment scenarios

  ## Output Expectations
  For each file updated, briefly note:
  - What was added/changed
  - What gaps were filled from official docs
  - Any remaining questions or areas needing clarification
